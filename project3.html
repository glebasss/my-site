            <h3><strong>Description by me</strong></h3>
        
            <p>This is my first dashboard and also my first project using DASH.</p>
            <p><strong>Specifically</strong>, this app has three pages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first page provides an overview with all categories, where you can analyze data by pressing some buttons and submitting. You can also click on the graphs to open a larger graph window. Below the graphs page, there are 8 cards which you can change while (rotating? or how to say? p.s believe you got it).</li>
                <li>The second page focuses on states. Here, you also have graphs, a timeline, and a large window that appears when clicking on specific elements.</li>
                <li>The third page is just about products.</li>
            </ul>
